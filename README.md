# dsp-voice-gender-recognition

## Introduction
Gender recognition from voice signals is an important problem in digital signal processing. The difference in vocal characteristics between males and females can be exploited for gender identification. This project presents an algorithm for gender recognition based on the amplitude of each audio sample.

## Implementation
For the implementation of the project we will use the MATLAB environment.
Also for the project we will use audio files with the **.wav** extension, so that there are no losses in the sound quality.

## Installation
For the installation we're going to use the **MATLAB** environment and the **Audio Toolbox** add-on.
